# Healing Stones â€“ GSoC 2025 Test (HumanAI)

This project is part of my application for Google Summer of Code 2025 under the HumanAI organization. The goal is to reconstruct a fragmented 3D Mayan stele using AI techniques on 3D model data.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Reconstruct the original artifact by aligning and assembling 12 3D fragments provided as `.PLY` or `.OBJ` files. All fragments are randomly rotated and may have missing sections due to wear or damage.
