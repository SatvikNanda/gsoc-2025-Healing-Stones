# Day 1: 
## What I did today:
1. Read and understood the GSoC Healing Stones test task under the HumanAI organization.
2. Downloaded the 3D dataset (17 .PLY fragments) from the Box.com link.
3. Installed required dependencies:
    open3d, numpy, matplotlib
4. Created a clean and organized project structure
5. Initialized a GitHub repo for version control.
6. Learned how to handle large files in Git using: .gitignore to exclude .PLY and .OBJ
7. Visualized a single 3D fragment using open3d.

## Key learning:
1. 3D visualization using open3d.draw_geometries()
2. Case sensitivity in file extensions can break visualization if not handled carefully
3. GitHub doesnâ€™t support large 3D files well, better to externalize with Drive
