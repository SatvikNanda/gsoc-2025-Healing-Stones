The objective of this folder is to store the manual ground truths which are obtained by manually aligning
pieces inside blender. This folder helps us store the transformation matrix of each piece to show the 
relative position of each piece in terms of numbers.

It also helps us to know which piece is adjacent to which piece further helping our model in future.
