"""
Code explanation:
1. Define the data path, path to the sorted csv file and output path for global assembly.
2. Read sorted ICP results.
3. Pick base fragment. (Most frequent fragment in top 20)
4. Initialise the global assembly and keep track of the fragments that are already added using set.
5. Start chaining fragments and skip if both already added.
6. Load and preprocess fragments and then run icp, both the functions are imported from icp_align2.
7. Finally, merge the point clouds.
7. Save the global assembly.(NOTE: added to gitignore due to large size)
